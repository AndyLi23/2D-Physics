# 2D-Physics
2D physics using pygame (no other physics libraries) based on the <speed, angle> vector model

circle_sim: physics of multiple circles with varying velocities

marble_sim: physics of a marble on polygons (WIP)

momentum_sim: simulation of two squares with varying masses colliding with each other and a solid wall to the left (inspired by 3Blue1Brown)
